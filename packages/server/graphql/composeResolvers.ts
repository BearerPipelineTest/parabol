/*
  GraphQL Shield has a great API but it uses graphql-middleware, which is horrendously slow.
  This is because the middleware wraps every single field. yikes!
  It also does typechecks in runtime that we can do at build time

  resolver-composition uses a barebones middleware, but the API is lacking (e.g. no caching, uses dot-separated strings for fields)
  So, I kept the Shield API for rules, but I don't run it through graphql-middleware
  Unfortunately, it still requires graphql-middleware, which is why it's a dependency

  This file accepts resolvers and permissions and applies permissions as higher order functions to those resolvers
